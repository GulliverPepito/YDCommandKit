/*!
 Find a command with a space separated path. Works recursively if the tree contains other command trees.
 
 For example, if the received had a command named "tree", which was a YDCommandTree with subcommands "add" and "list",
 "tree" would return the tree, and "tree add" would return the "add" command added to "tree".
 
 Its recursive nature works really well if you have a "help" command in your app and you want to print usage for specific subcommands.
